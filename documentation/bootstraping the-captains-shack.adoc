= Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is the process of setting up a basic server configuration from a bare installation. What is done here
is based on several assumptions: 

* the target OS is Centos 7
* the client OS is Mac OSX. This is the workstation I use for doing all my manipulations.
* vagrant/Virtualbox is used to validate the different cookbooks
* 

Install Ansible

* `sudo easy_install pip`
* `sudo pip install ansible --quiet`
* (`sudo pip install ansible --upgrade` to upgrade Ansible)

As I use some special features only available in Ansible v2, this is how to run Ansible from sources:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive
$ cd ./ansible
----

To update the version,

[source,bash]
----
$ git pull --rebase
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
----

To initiate the environment,

[source,bash]
----
$ source ./hacking/env-setup
----




setup the ansible host list so that the servers can be found when executing Ansible commands.


[source,bash]
./etc/ansible/hosts
----
[kimsufi]
 91.121.164.117:10022

[vagrant]
 localhost:2222`
----


== Configuration of the test environment

* Install a blank vagrant Centos box. You should use the supplied vagrantfile. Important: to represent correctly a blank system
the SSH part of the vagrantfile should be commented out. And commented back when the bootstrap has been executed. This is due to
the change of the deported ssh port.
