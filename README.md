A random experimentation about a Docker hosting server configured with Ansible.

It might turn out like this.

To read what it does, you can refer to the Captain's Shack [functionality list](documentation/the-captains-shack.adoc)

Refer to the [HOWTO](HOWTO.adoc) to figure out how to bootstrap the server. The `bootstrap.yml` is the entry point of the Ansible
provisioning system.

To see the work still ahead, have a look to the [TODO](TODO.md) file.
