# The Captain's Shack

A random experimentation about a Docker hosting server configured with Ansible.

It might turn out like this.

To read what it does, you can refer to the Captain's Shack [functionality list](documentation/the-captains-shack_functionalities.adoc)

I keep logs of my explorations [here](captains-logs/overview.md).

Refer to the [HOWTO](documentation/HOWTO.adoc) to figure out how to bootstrap the server. The `configure-shack.yml` is the entry point of the Ansible
provisioning system.

Refer to the [re-initialize checklist](documentation/init_the-captains-shack.md) for a quick rebuild of the Captain's Shack from 
a blank kimsufi server.

To see the work still ahead, have a look to the [TODO](TODO.md) file.
